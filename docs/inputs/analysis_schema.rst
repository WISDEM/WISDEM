aero_shape
========================================


Design variables associated with the blade aerodynamic shape



twist
----------------------------------------


Blade twist as a design variable by adding or subtracting radians from the initial value at spline control points along the span.

:code:`flag` : Boolean
    Activates as a design variable or constraint

    *Default* = False

:code:`inverse` : Boolean
    When set to True, the twist is defined inverting the 
    blade-element momentum equations to achieve a desired margin to stall, 
    which is defined among the constraints.
    :code:`flag` and :code:`inverse` cannot be simultaneously be set to True

    *Default* = False

:code:`n_opt` : Integer
    Number of equally-spaced control points of the spline
    parametrizing the twist distribution along blade span. 

    *Default* = 8

    *Minimum* = 4

:code:`lower_bound` : Array of Floats, rad
    Lowest number of radians that can be added (typically negative to
    explore smaller twist angles)

    *Default* = [-0.1, -0.1, -0.1, -0.1, -0.1, -0.1, -0.1, -0.1]

:code:`upper_bound` : Array of Floats, rad
    Largest number of radians that can be added (typically postive to
    explore greater twist angles)

    *Default* = [0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1]

:code:`lock_root` : Integer
    Integer setting how many DVs along span are locked starting from blade root.
    By default, the first two points are locked to prevent the optimizer to try to
    optimize the twist of the blade root cylinder.

    *Default* = 2

:code:`lock_tip` : Integer
    Integer setting how many DVs along span are locked starting from blade tip.

    *Default* = 0


chord
----------------------------------------


Blade chord as a design variable by scaling (multiplying) the initial value at spline control points along the span.

:code:`flag` : Boolean
    Activates as a design variable or constraint

    *Default* = False

:code:`n_opt` : Integer
    Number of equally-spaced control points of the spline
    parametrizing the chord distribution along blade span.

    *Default* = 8

    *Minimum* = 4

:code:`min_gain` : Float
    Lower bound on scalar multiplier that will be applied to value at
    control points

:code:`max_gain` : Float
    Upper bound on scalar multiplier that will be applied to value at
    control points

    *Default* = 1.5

:code:`lock_root` : Integer
    Integer setting how many DVs along span are locked starting from blade root.
    By default, the first two points close to blade root are
    locked. The first two points impact the diameter of the blade root
    cylinder, and the models implemented in WISDEM do not have the
    level of fidelity to appropriately size the blade root diameter.

    *Default* = 2

:code:`lock_tip` : Integer
    Integer setting how many DVs along span are locked starting from blade tip.
    The last point controls the chord length at blade tip and due to
    the imperfect tip loss models of CCBlade, it is usually a good
    idea to taper the chord manually and do not let a numerical
    optimizer control it. The default is therefore set to 1.

    *Default* = 1


af_positions
----------------------------------------


Adjust airfoil positions along the blade span.

:code:`flag` : Boolean
    Activates as a design variable or constraint

    *Default* = False

    position. The airfoil at blade tip is always locked. It is advised

    control points

    *Default* = 1.5

:code:`lock_root` : Integer
    Integer setting how many DVs along span are locked starting from blade root.

    manufacturability constraint.

    *Default* = 1

:code:`lock_tip` : Integer
    Integer setting how many DVs along span are locked starting from blade tip.
