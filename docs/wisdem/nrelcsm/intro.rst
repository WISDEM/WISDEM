The set of models contained in this software allow for the determination of wind plant cost of energy including models for turbine capital costs, balance of station costs, operations and maintenance costs, and annual energy production.  It is a direct implementation of the model described in :cite:`Fingersh2006` with modifications as described in :cite:`Maples2010`.
