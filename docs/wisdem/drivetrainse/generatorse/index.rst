=======================

.. only:: html

    GeneratorSE is specifically intended for optimizing variable-speed wind turbine generators. 

    The software provides users with the ability to customize the generator design, thereby satisfying certain design requirements. As a result, users can achieve optimal performance of the entire wind turbine drivetrain by negotiating certain fundamental, interdependent factors such as weight, cost, and efficiency to meet the wind turbine original equipment manufacturers objectives.
