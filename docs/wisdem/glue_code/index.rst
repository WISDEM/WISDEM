    A Python script wrapping all the WISDEM modules into a single workflow.

    Once WISDEM is installed, the glue code can be visualized by navigating in a terminal to wisdem/glue_code and then type

.. code-block:: python

    openmdao n2 runWISDEM.py


The result will look like this image, which you can dynamically navigate folding and unfolding each block with the commands on the left of the screen.
