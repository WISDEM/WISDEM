Significant effort has been invested to develop an _ontology_ for wind turbines systems analysis by the `IEA Wind Task 37 on Systems Engineering <https://iea-wind.org/task37/>`_, which ran between 2016 and 2022, and `IEA Wind Task 55 on Reference Wind Turbines and Wind Plants <https://iea-wind.org/task55/>`_` in its `windIO <https://github.com/IEAWindSystems/windIO>`_ project.  WISDEM uses the windIO turbine ontology for the physical description of the turbine, and its components, and the required level of fidelity for systems analysis.

Full documentation of windIO can be found at the `windIO documentation <https://ieawindsystems.github.io/windIO/main/index.html>`_

Note that in some turbine components WISDEM takes as input more fields than what listed in windIO. This is especially true for the drivetrain components.

The extra inputs are documented below.
