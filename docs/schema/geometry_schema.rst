Significant effort has been invested to develop an _ontology_ for wind turbines systems analysis by the IEA Wind Task 37 - Systems Engineering in its `WindIO <https://github.com/IEAWindTask37/windIO>`_ project.  WISDEM uses this ontology for the physical description of the turbine, and its components, and the required level of fidelity for systems analysis.

Full documentation of WindIO can be found at the `WindIO documentation <https://windio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/turbine.html>`_

Specific implementation of WindIO within WISDEM is explained below.
