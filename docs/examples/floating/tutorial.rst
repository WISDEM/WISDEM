9. Floating Platform Examples
-----------------------------

.. warning::
   In our use of FloatingSE, we have not been able to obtain conceptual platform geometry results that we trust are valid and worth pursuing further.  This may be due to a fundamental error in the formulation and implementation of FloatingSE.  It may also be due to the inherent limitations in using steady-state or quasi-static analysis methods to tackle a problem that is driven by its dynamic nature and dynamic loads.  NREL currently advises against reliance on FloatingSE.  Instead, we are developing a multifidelity floating turbine and platform design capability in the `Wind Energy with Integrated Servo-control (WEIS) project <https://github.com/WISDEM/WEIS>`_.
