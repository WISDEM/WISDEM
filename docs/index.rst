WISDEM |reg| Documentation
====================

The Wind-plant Integrated System Design and Engineering Model (WISDEM) includes integrated assemblies for the assessment of system behavior of wind turbines and plants. These assemblies can be used as is, but a richer use-case involves treating the assemblies as temples, modifying the source code and `OpenMDAO <https://openmdao.org/>`_ problems to answer specific research questions.  For example, any variable in these assemblies can be a design variable, an objective, or part of a constraint in a multidisciplinary optimization. WISDEM should therefore be viewed a toolbox of analysis tools and the basic structure for connecting tools across subsystems and fidelity levels, which can be extended in a multitude of directions according to the userâ€™s needs.
