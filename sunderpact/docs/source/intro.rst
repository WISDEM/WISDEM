Introduction
------------

The set of models contained in this software allow for the determination of dimensions and mass properties for major hub and drivetrain components of a wind turbine.  The software combines sources of information from several areas: The NREL Cost and Scaling Model :cite:`Fingersh2006` and related subsequent cost model development efforts, the Wind Partnerships for Advanced Component Technology (WindPACT) work that occurred between roughly 2002 to 2005 :cite:`WindPACT`, and the University of Sunderland (the Sunderland Model) :cite:`Sunderland1993`.  The goal of the development of the following set of models for the hub and nacelle are to return to a semi-empirical physical representation of the turbine that allows one to assess the impact of design changes on mass via a few updates to the Sunderland model in key areas of limitation related to outdated design criteria.  The resulting models contain two key areas:

1) A physical model for sizing each of the major hub and drivetrain components based on design loads as they are transferred through the wind turbine system.

2) A model of the Mass Moments of Inertia for each of the components based on an assumption of homogenous distribution of homogeneous material throughout a simplified geometric structure.
